To run the suite of analysis:





























Fig1:  (somewhat intro)
	- Generic; where sequencing data comes from
	- why it's compositional, what data we're interested in
	- Assumption: most variables (describe features, otus) are invariant or randomly varying
	- If there's systematic variations between groups (because of pres/absence or changes in abundance/relative abundance) then this assumption is broken
	- Can see this broken assumption in a shift in a biplot or effect plot between the mass of the data points (could show histogram here)

Hypothesis is that:
Identifying the variables with the most consistent (midpoint/typical) variance in all samples will correct for this centering problem/defect

- We can identify the bulk of the data and adjust this to zero 

Introduce the formula (CLR formula) + (Find variance) 
	- Point estimate 
	- Dirichlet MC. Replicates
	- There's 2 ways
			- doing as point shifts on biplot
			- MC shifts on effect plot 

Fig2: (methods/intro/results)
	- Helps to explain what's going on  (simulated data)
	- Model data (transcriptome) Doesn't matter what kind, modeled as count from neg.binomial dist (generate selex data)
	- Use artificial dataset at first, Use supplimentary S1,S2,S3, doesn't matter source of the data and we can replicate this shift 
		- Reiterate that it's count data and the source doesn't matter

	- 2a The data is UNCENTERED (Original ALDEx2)
	- 2b The adjusted data 		(Adjusted ALDEx2)
	- a and a' as effect and biplots 
	- b and b' as effect and biplots 

^^ Methods/Introduction
	- a is generic sequencing is introduction
	- b is methods, setting up the example dataset + problem



	- Consider plotting a histogram ontop of the effect plot (inlaid plot)

Fig3: (results)
	- demonstrate this phenomenon in a real dataset, Selex dataset
	- Try microbiome dataset(s) that are very different (HMP dataset) (tongue/stool)
	- a + b to use effect plots 	
	- Phenomenon in REAL dataset needs to be combined with zero removal adjustment or else it doesn't work
	
	
	

Fig4/Tab1: (discussion)
	- What happens in "good data"
	- IDeal data/model data
	- Transcriptome, tongue/cheek (whichever data that doesn't have off centering)
	- Doesn't have an effect on "ideal data" or "good data" but only affects bad data
	
	- Use yeast transcriptome dataset that I drew the simulated data from, or use a tongue/cheek dataset with no off centering 
	- Demonstrate original ALDEx2 and Adjusted ALDEx2 





TODO:
	1) Centered/Uncentered w/ phi
		- Univariate test but we may be affecting multivariate 
	2) MiRKAT? 
		- 
	3) Per/Group or Whole group?
		- (1 condition or 2 condition)

NOTE:
	- Do 1 group test first
	- 2nd problem is that if your groups are very different you can have 2 different groups (supplementary)
		- In the absence of 2 distinct groups it doesn't change (supplementary)


	- Make a script per figure
	- Make bold comments if 1 major script 
	- s



Potential Publication Sites:
(1)	- BMC Bioinformatics
	- Bioinformatics (real data, even though they're theoretical)
	- Conference paper for next CoDa meeting
	- Submit w/ analysis of real dataset
	- Algorithms in Biology (older bioinformatics journal)
	- Genome Biology (need to show that it has huge effect)

Implemented as a new package*
	- If your data is very sparse, the alternative approach is...
	- Zero removal works in very extreme cases
		Extend the models or problems (really unbalanced set of sparsity) therefore zero removal fixes that, only do if desparate
		
	one more example for really unbalanced 



Add dashed white line ontop of the ablines
